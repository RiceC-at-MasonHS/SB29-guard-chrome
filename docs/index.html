        <h1>Privacy Policy for the "SB29-guard-chrome" Extension</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 27, 2025</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The "SB29-guard-chrome" extension was built with student and teacher privacy as its highest priority. Our guiding principle is **zero data collection**. This extension **does not** collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or browsing activity.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            To protect your privacy, the extension is designed to perform all of its checks locally on your computer. The process is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Fetching the Master List:</strong> Periodically (approximately once per day), the extension anonymously downloads an official list of websites and their data privacy agreement (DPA) statuses from a secure, district-managed server. This is the only network communication the extension performs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> This list is stored locally within the extension on your computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Checks:</strong> When you visit a website, the extension checks the URL against the list it has stored locally. Your browsing history, the sites you visit, and any other personal data **never leave your computer**.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Information We Explicitly DO NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We want to be perfectly clear. The "SB29-guard-chrome" extension does not have access to, nor does it collect, any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your browsing history</li>
            <li>Your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
            <li>Data you enter into forms on websites</li>
            <li>Your IP address</li>
            <li>Any other data related to your online activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            If we ever update this policy, we will reflect the changes on this page. The core principle of zero data collection will not change.
        </p>
