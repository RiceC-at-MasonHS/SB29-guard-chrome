# Icons

All icons designed in Inkscape v1.4

The icons are on six different 'pages' that can be exported separately. 
(That is why they don't all show in a VS Code preview window.)

## Design Requirements:

The icons should be quintessentially clear. 
- They need to be distinct colors, visible without much attention. Ideally distant, vibrant hues on a color-wheel. 
- They need to be clear on any background color (as users are free to set their Chrome Theme).
- Each must have a distinct shape, for accesability considerations of low-color-vision users.
- The 'badge' should clearly identify for users that some apps are installed (from an app store) as this may change the way they evaluate their use of the application.
